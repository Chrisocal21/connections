# RECLAIMED: Gameplay Guide

## Game Overview

RECLAIMED is a post-apocalyptic survival and settlement management game set in a world recovering from "The Quiet Reset," an orchestrated global event that placed most of humanity in stasis. Players awaken from cryosleep to discover a transformed Earth where they must rebuild civilization by managing resources, expanding their settlement, and unraveling the mystery behind what happened.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Gather resources** through scavenging, building production facilities
2. **Expand your settlement** by constructing buildings and improving infrastructure
3. **Recruit survivors** with different skills to enhance your community
4. **Explore the world** to discover new locations and uncover story elements
5. **Manage your leadership** to gain trust and improve community effectiveness

## Key Resources

- **Food**: Required daily to sustain your population. Can be obtained through scavenging and farming.
- **Water**: Essential resource needed daily. Gathered through scavenging and water collection systems.
- **Materials**: Used for building construction and upgrades. Scavenged from ruins.
- **People**: Survivors who join your community. Increase production but consume resources.

## Actions

Each day, you have a limited number of actions to perform:

- **Scavenge**: Search for food, water, and materials in nearby areas
- **Build**: Construct new structures that improve resource production or community capabilities
- **Explore**: Discover new areas, potentially finding survivors and special resources
- **End Day**: Conclude the current day, advancing to the next (consumes resources)

## Buildings

- **Shelters**: House more survivors and improve community morale
- **Farms**: Produce food each day, reducing reliance on scavenging
- **Cisterns**: Collect and purify water, providing a steady water supply
- **Workshops**: Increase material production and enable crafting

## Weather System

Weather conditions change daily and affect gameplay:
- **Clear**: Normal resource gathering
- **Rainy**: Improved water collection, reduced scavenging efficiency
- **Stormy**: Reduced outdoor activities, potential damage to structures
- **Dry**: Water scarcity, increased food consumption
- **Cold**: Increased resource consumption, reduced farm output

## Leadership System

Leadership increases through:

## Journal System

## Story Progression

The game story unfolds across four phases:
1. **Awakening**: Focus on basic survival and initial discoveries
2. **Survival**: Developing self-sufficiency and facing first challenges
3. **Expansion**: Growing your community and forming alliances
