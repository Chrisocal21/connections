# RECLAIMED: Story and Lore

## The Quiet Reset

The Quiet Reset was a global event that occurred approximately 50 years before the start of the game. What initially appeared to be a series of environmental disasters, technological failures, and societal collapses was actually an orchestrated event by powerful entities to "reset" civilization.

### Timeline

- **Protocol Zero Activation (2035)**: Secret government and corporate coalition implements "The Quiet Reset" protocol.
- **Operation Sleepwalker (2035-2040)**: Mass deployment of biological agents designed to place large portions of population into a stasis-like state.
- **The Collapse (2040-2050)**: Civilization as known breaks down. Those in power retreat to secure facilities and cryosleep chambers.
- **The Silent Years (2050-2075)**: Earth begins healing. Most of humanity in stasis or cryosleep.
- **The Awakening (2075-Present)**: Cryopods begin to fail, awakening survivors who must rebuild.
